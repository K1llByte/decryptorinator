# Cyphertext #2

The letter frequency table generated was:

|J|A|I|V|S|G|H|Y|Z|N|P|E|U|L|K|Q|T|R|W|M|F|O|C|D|B|X|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|12.2034| 11.6102| 8.5593| 7.7119| 7.6271| 7.4576| 6.2712| 5.5085| 4.0678| 3.8136| 3.6441| 3.1356| 3.1356| 2.4576| 2.4576| 2.2034| 1.6949| 1.6949| 1.4407| 1.3559| 1.2712| 0.339| 0.1695| 0.0847| 0.0847| 0.0|

The letter frequency table created for this text doesn't match any special word easy to deduce (it only helped find the letter I that was the S).

So the next step is to manually find some absolute letters translations to try find some words.

The hint word i'll find now is a 3 letter word with 2 equal letters at the end '_JGG_'

This ciphered word could be '_too_' or '_all_', The word i think it represents is the first one because i suspect the word '_JHA_' is '_the_'

One letter is not present in this cryptogram, the letter: _X_

. . .

# Cyphertext #3

This text seems easier because the letter frequency swap showed some complete words such as '_THE_', '_AT_', '_THEM_'

This words found could obviously wrong and be just a coincidence but for a start we'll assume

GQX -> THE

Exacly the same strategy of the Cyphertext #2

Three letters are not present in this cryptogram, the letter: _D_, _E_ and _W_
